# Python Functions Tasks – Intermediate Hands-On 1

## Overview
This collection contains **5 hands-on Python tasks** designed for intermediate learners focusing on **functions** with combined use of **dictionaries, lists, loops, and conditionals**.  

Each task presents a **real-life inspired scenario** (such as hospitals, banks, quizzes, and voting systems) to help learners apply Python functions in practical ways while strengthening logical problem-solving skills.  

These tasks emphasize:
- Defining and calling **functions**  
- Using `return` effectively  
- Iterating with **loops** over lists and dictionaries  
- Applying **if/elif/else** conditionals for decision-making  
- Managing data with **dictionaries and lists**  

Some tasks also introduce nested dictionaries to simulate **real-world structured data**.

## How to Use
Clone the project using:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cohort-III-web2-Beginners/python-functions-hands-on-6.git
```


Then:
```
cd python-functions-hands-on-6/
```
Remove the original .git folder to create your own repo:
```
rm -rf .git/
```
Then, initialize your own git repo:


```
git init
```


Start simple: write one small function at a time.

 - Test each function with sample input/output before moving on.

- Use print while debugging, but always keep a return value in your final solution.
- Think about real-world behavior (e.g., a patient with no record should return “Not Found”).
