Bank Account Simulation

Task:
- Manage simple bank accounts.
- Store accounts in dictionary { "account_number": {"name": str, "balance": float} }
- Deposit, withdraw, transfer between accounts.
- Use *args for batch deposits/withdrawals.
- Use **kwargs for flexible account creation (e.g., overdraft_limit).

// NOT FOR THIS TASK
Future OOP Extension:
- BankAccount class with methods deposit(), withdraw(), transfer().
- Bank class to manage all accounts.
